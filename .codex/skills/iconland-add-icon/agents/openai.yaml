    default_prompt: 'Add this icon pair to grauity using the iconland workflow. Use explicit icon Type and name (ask for them if missing), ignore uploaded filenames, run the manual skill steps, then create a grauity branch using the repository branch naming convention, commit, push, and open a PR. For Slack connector checks, first read SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_GRAUITY_CODEX_CONNECTOR from env and if it is missing use SLACK_BOT_TOKEN as fallback. If posting to Slack, use the global slack-bot skill when available; otherwise resolve user IDs and user-group IDs, convert links to Slack link format, preserve rich text in mrkdwn, and then post.'
