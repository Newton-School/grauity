    default_prompt: 'Add this icon pair to grauity using the iconland workflow. Use explicit icon Type and name (ask for them if missing), ignore uploaded filenames, run the skill script, then create a grauity branch using the repository branch naming convention, commit, push, and open a PR. If posting to Slack, resolve @mentions to Slack user IDs so the mentions render correctly.'
