# Theming with ThemeScope

To use theming in your app, simply wrap your components with the `ThemeScope` component.
- To maintain the theme of the parent component, no need of `ThemeScope` as this is the default behavior.
- To change the theme, use the `applyTheme` prop of `ThemeScope`. Available themes are:
  - `light`
  - `dark`
- To invert the theme of the parent component, use the `invert` prop of `ThemeScope`.
